            <p>
                My name is Conor Cloyd. I am a junior in high school. <br><br> My interests are programming, legos, music, video games, and writing. 
            My favorite sports teams are the Chicago Cubs, Kansas City Chiefs, and Iowa Hawkeyes. I run cross country, play baseball, and participate in my school's robotics team.
            <br><br>I was born on December 16th, 2007 in Iowa City. Ever since I was young, I've always had a sense to create. As far back as first grade, I drew sketches of video games that I wanted to make.
            It wasn't until 6th grade when I had the opportunity to create video games. 
            <br><br>In what was probably the nerdiest thing I've ever done, me and a group of friends negotiated with the principal and the IT guy Bryan Babcock to stay in one recess a day to work on video games.
            <br><br>It worked, and from that day we stayed in one recess a day and began working on video games...
            <br><br>Until COVID hit, and we got 2 extra months of summer break.
            <br><br>In my 7th grade year, me and some friends were selected to work in Babcock's office. It was part of his IT internship program. We would be back there, repairing laptops, working on projects, and going to other 
            tech related competitions. One of these competitions was Byte Jam.
            <br><br>In our 7th grade year, the theme for Byte Jam was patriotic. We held meetings during lunch about the direction of our game. We bounced ideas around, but settled on a battle-royale style World War I video game.
            <br><br>Due to COVID that year, the competition was completely virtual, so we had to send in the project file, and a video about the game. As far as I know, the video has been lost to time. As far as the video game went, I learned a lot.
            I also learned that making a video game was a very big undertaking, especially for a relatively unexperienced 12 year old. The farthest we ever got to a functioning video game was the map, which was just an arena of "trenches", and the player,
            which was just the default first person shooter template. 
            <br><br>We didn't submit a project for Byte Jam in 2020.
            <br><br>But the experience I gained from developing my first video game was invaluable.
            <br><br>The next year, the theme for Byte Jam was cyberpunk. That year, the competition was actually in person on campus, and it was the first year that we actually submitted a video game. However, our game was a clunky, buggy, laggy mess and didn't score very high.
            <br><br>That year I also joined the school's robotics club, which involved us making a robot for a competition up in Cedar Falls. We were very unexperienced and didn't rank very high.
            <br><br>Next year the theme for Byte Jam was superhero. This year marked a very important milestone for me and my team. It was the first year that we actually won an award for Byte Jam. We won the student choice award for the Byte division, which was surprising because our game wasn't very good. Our points were essentially from presentation alone.
            <br><br>It wasn't until next year when we truly showed what we were capable of as a team. 
            <br><br>Next year's Byte Jam theme was retro 90's. I was really excited about this theme because I had grew up playing some of my grandma's old Nintendo 64 games, and I knew the exact style and feel I wanted for our game. I went with a Goldeneye 007 style shooter, complete with blocky, low poly models. Our game was good enough as it is, but after going to a garage sale the weekend before, I discovered an old CRT monitor that would be perfect for our display.
            <br><br>Our game quickly caught the attention of the attendees. Our game was fun, challenging, and was nearly a perfect recreation of the games I played on my grandma's Nintendo 64.
            <br><br>Our team, Chris Hansen's Co-Stars, won first place for the Byte division in 2024.
            <br><br>As I prepare for college, my passions remain the same as they have been for most of my life. I plan to pursue a career in software or video game development. I plan to get my associate's degree at Indian Hills, and to pursue further education elsewhere.
